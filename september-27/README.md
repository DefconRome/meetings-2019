## Smashing the SOP for fun and profit, by bonaff and TheNodi

Web sites are slaves of a program called "Same Origin Policy (SOP)".
Due to this program, the reality perceived by web sites is not the actual reality.
It is a dream world which is almost similar to the real world.
But since web sites have no idea about this, they react to every situation in the dream world as they do in the real world.
Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible.
Instead, only try to realize the truth: all web sites are in the same world.
In the talk, we will show the rules all web sites are constrained by when they try to communicate with each other.
And, of course, because you are the chosen ones, you will learn how to bend them to your will and join us in the marvelous world of web exploiting.
